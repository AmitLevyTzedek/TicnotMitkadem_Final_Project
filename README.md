# TicnotMitkadem_Final_Project

## background
This project is the final project for the Advanced Programming course at Bar-Ilan University, Faculty of Engineering.
In this project, we aim to implement and create a server that can be accessed remotely via a web browser.
Our goal is to design and build a fully functional and visually appealing website using all the components and techniques covered throughout the course.

The website will allow users to upload text files, which will then be processed to generate a computational graph that visually represents the input data from the uploaded file.

In addition, we will provide an option to assign output values to the graph's nodes and display both the inputs and outputs in a table, showcasing the graph's computations clearly.
